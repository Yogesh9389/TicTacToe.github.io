Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns placing X's or O's on a 3x3 grid with the goal of getting three in a row. When playing against an AI, the player competes against a computer program that uses algorithms and machine learning techniques to make intelligent moves. The AI may use various strategies, such as minimizing the player's potential win or maximizing its own, to make its moves. The game can be played on various platforms, including websites, mobile apps, and gaming consoles.
